# TransactionTracker

This is my first-ever self-designed, self-implemented project. The idea came from my personal interest which is sneakers. Version1 is made up within 2 days and there are many defects in it since it was rushed. The programming language used in this project is python with its package Tkinter for the user interface. Pyinstaller was used to generate the executable file.
